# Cognition Starter Pack
## Razor Edition

Doing Occam proud.

## Use It

    npm install
    gulp

Now gulp is serving your SPA at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Hack on the stuff in `public` and make a totally sweet, game changing app or whatever.

## Optionally

Pass things via env vars:

    PORT=4000 gulp

Now gulp is serving your project at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). UH mazing.

## Fun for the Whole Family

You got Chrome? No? Do that.

Ok, now try this [livereload extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en).
All it does is inject a spot of javascript into your page (when it's turned on)
that causes the client to listen to the server for notice. When the server says
so, the client will reload the page.

By default, the webserver that runs this app has the `livereload` option
enabled, so use it!
